The Sine functions here is only set for the change of some specific genes in the nucleus. The number of gene is measured in proportion. 
For example, 1 means all these specific genes are in the nucleus, whereas 0 means all these specific genes are in the cytoplasm.   
(func10.m is used for current (grey) simulation. func7.m is used for RGB simulation)  
  
  You may uncomment the code in **_Diaplay funcs_** section if you need to see the plot of these functions
